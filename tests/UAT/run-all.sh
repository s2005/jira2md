# run-all.sh - sequential roster runner for every guided UAT walkthrough beside
# it.
#
# Runs the roster below strictly one guide at a time - never in parallel, never
# in the background. Nothing serializes concurrent access to the shared fixture,
# so two overlapping guide runs would corrupt each other. That is the whole
# reason this is a plain sequential loop rather than anything fancier.
#
# For each guide: print a banner, run ./<name>.sh --auto <passthrough>, capture
# its exit code, and carry on to the next guide regardless of the result. At the
# end print a roster table - one row per guide with its exit code and a verdict -
# then exit.
#
# Exit-code semantics per guide (see common.sh for where these codes come from):
#   0   -> PASS
#   3   -> SKIPPED (prerequisite) - does NOT fail the roster. A guide whose
#          prerequisite only a prior guide's optional deploy creates reports 3
#          on a default run, and treating that as a failure would make a
#          default run useless.
#   130 -> the operator pressed Ctrl-C. Stop the whole run immediately and exit
#          130 - do not carry on through the remaining guides.
#   *   -> FAIL, recorded, and the loop continues to the next guide.
#
# run-all.sh itself exits 0 when no guide FAILed, 1 otherwise.
#
# No `set -e`: a guide's own non-zero exit is the normal, expected case this
# script exists to observe and report, not an error to abort on.

run-all.sh - run every guided UAT walkthrough in this directory, one at a time

Runs the roster below strictly one guide at a time - never in parallel, never
in the background - because nothing serializes concurrent access to the shared
fixture; two overlapping runs would corrupt each other.

Usage:
  ./run-all.sh [options]

Options:
  --auto, --no-pause     Accepted for consistency with every other UAT script.
                         run-all.sh always passes --auto to each guide it runs,
                         regardless of this flag: a roster run is unattended by
                         definition, and a per-step keypress prompt in the
                         middle of the roster would hang it.
  --stop-on-fail         Passed through to every guide, so each guide's OWN step
                         loop stops at its first failed step. Does NOT stop the
                         roster itself: the roster always runs every guide and
                         reports every result (use --only to run just one).
  --url URL              Passed through project.sh: Jira base URL override.
  --email EMAIL          Passed through project.sh: account email override.
  --token TOKEN          Passed through project.sh: API token / PAT override.
  --key KEY              Passed through project.sh: primary fixture issue key.
  --key-second KEY       Passed through project.sh: second fixture issue key.
  --keep-output          Passed through to every guide: keep the files each
                         guide writes instead of deleting them.
  --only NAME            Run exactly one guide from the roster instead of all
                         of them.
  --list, --list-steps   Print the roster order and exit 0.
  --help                 Show this help and exit

Prerequisites: the same shared setup every guide in the roster assumes - see
README.md.

--seed, --cleanup, --from-step and --only-step are guide-internal flags - they
address one guide's own fixture or step numbers, not the roster as a whole -
and are not accepted here. Run the specific guide script directly for those
(e.g. ./jira2md.sh --seed), or use --only NAME to run just one guide
through this runner.

Exit codes: 0 when no guide FAILed (a SKIPPED guide does not count as a
failure), 1 when at least one guide FAILed, 130 if interrupted (stops the
roster immediately; no further guides run).
